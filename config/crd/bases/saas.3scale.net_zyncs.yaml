                          pods selected by "selector" are unavailable after the eviction,
                          i.e. even in absence of the evicted pod. For example, one
                          can prevent all voluntary evictions by specifying 0. This
                          is a mutually exclusive setting with "minAvailable".

                          for example you can prevent all voluntary evictions by specifying
                          "100%".
